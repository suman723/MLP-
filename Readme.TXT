MLP Experiments in Machine Learning: XOR, SIN, and Letter Recognition
Overview
This programming assignment by Suman Shil comprises several Jupyter notebooks and text files focusing on different machine learning experiments. The project explores multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) across various datasets and problems. Key experiments include:

XOR Test (Q1_XOR): An MLP implementation for solving the XOR problem. Includes multiple configurations with varying epochs, learning rates, and seven hidden units.
SIN Test (Q2_SIN): Details are not provided in the README, but likely involves an MLP application related to sine wave prediction or classification.
Letter Recognition (Q3_Letter): Focuses on the letter recognition dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, likely involving MLP for letter recognition or classification.
Usage Instructions
Environment
The programs can be executed in Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or a suitable Python IDE like VS Code.

Data
For the letter recognition experiment, download the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Execution
Each file (notebook) can be executed separately. Ensure to adjust the output file name or delete the existing one before running the programs.

Customization
Experiment with different numbers of epochs and hidden layers to modify results, improve accuracy, or reduce error rate.

Additional Notes
The assignment includes detailed output logs and results in text files, providing insights into the MLP models' performance under various configurations. It features pre and post-training results, error rates, and accuracy measurements.







All three files can be executed separately,
MLP class defination in all file are almost same.
before starting execution of this file either delete output file or change name of file from code.
All can be excute with the help of jupytor notebook or Google golab notebook or vs code editor
